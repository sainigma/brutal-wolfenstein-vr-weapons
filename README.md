## Description

This is a mod for ZioMcCall's [Brutal Wolfenstein 3D mod](https://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?f=19&t=48035) that replaces the weapon sprites with animated 3d models and modifies the weapon scripts for general VR comfort and compatibility with [GZDoomVR](https://github.com/hh79/gzdoomvr) project.

So basically it's a mod for the sum of two mods, what a wild intersection.

Following weapons are supported: Luger, MP40, STG44, Kar98, MG42, Colt 1911A1, Thompson M1A1, M1 Garand, Winchester M12 Trench Gun.

..While these weapons were not carried over: All akimbo versions, The Axe, BAR, Chaingun, Knife, Flamethrower, Laser rifle, Panzershreck, PPSH41
